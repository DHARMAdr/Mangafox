   MangaFlow Reader - app.js
   Every section has:  WHY (why it exists)  |  HOW (how it works)  |  IMPROVE (how to make it better later)
   Plain English on purpose: this file is also a lesson for beginners.

   HOW THE WHOLE THING WORKS
   1. You type a URL. Browsers forbid reading other sites directly (CORS), so we ask a small
      "CORS proxy" to fetch the page's HTML for us.
   2. We show that HTML in a sandboxed iframe and intercept link clicks (a mini browser).
   3. "Reading mode" scans the page for chapter links and chapter images, then loads chapters one
      after another into a single endless scroll.
   4. At the end of the page, "Download" builds ONE PDF of every loaded chapter (pdfmaker.js).

   WHAT IS NEW IN THIS VERSION (round 2)
   - Series pages now show their chapter list (the site fills it with JavaScript, we fetch it ourselves)
     and "Read first chapter" works. Links are made safe BEFORE the page finishes loading.
   - Reading mode hides its buttons when you scroll DOWN and shows them only when you scroll UP.
   - Settings has an editable list of CORS proxies. Free ones are added automatically.
   - Arrow buttons are drawn like a keyboard's arrow cluster.
   - History remembers the exact chapter; "Continue reading" reopens it.
   - PDF download of everything loaded in reading mode.
   - Phones get a floating search bar.

   WHAT IS NEW IN ROUND 8
   - Reader keys: ONE row of round 3D buttons (reload chapter, reload all, previous, next, END). End key works too.
   - The manga title hides on scroll down like the other buttons; a search / link bar was added to reading mode.
   - A pasted manga link (or a click on a chapter) opens straight in reading mode.
   - The download dock sits above the keys, starts minimised while you read, and never stops when minimised.
   - Wider picture detection (pictures hidden in scripts, srcset), picture retry through your proxy, polite
     request speed, and BIG error pop-ups with a copyable report for every problem or blocked attack.
   ===================================================================== */
// WHY: wraps the whole file in a function that runs at once, so our variables stay private and do not leak into the
// page. HOW: '(() => { ... })()' defines and calls an arrow function. IMPROVE: split the file into modules
// (import/export) so it is easier to read.
(() => {
  // WHY: turns on strict mode so silly mistakes (like using an undeclared variable) throw errors instead of hiding. HOW:
  // the browser reads this special string at the top of the function. IMPROVE: modules are strict by default, so this goes
  // away if you switch.
  'use strict';

  /* ---------------------------------------------------------------
     0. SECURITY BASICS  (round 7)
     WHY: this is a browser-only site, so the protections are the ones a browser can do by itself:
          1. Anti-clickjacking: if another website shows MangaFlow inside its own frame (to trick clicks),
             we blank the page and open ourselves normally. (A header on your host is stronger, see _headers.)
          2. safeWebUrl(): only http(s) addresses are ever opened or fetched. javascript:, data:, file: ... are refused.
          3. Pages from other sites are cleaned (renderFrame) and shown in a frame WITHOUT scripts.
          4. A Content-Security-Policy in index.html stops any script that is not ours.
          5. Everything shown from the outside is written with textContent (never as HTML), so a manga title like
             "<img onerror=...>" is just text.
     IMPROVE: add a "report a problem" link, and use Subresource Integrity if you ever load a library from a CDN. */
  // WHY: stops clickjacking, where another site shows MangaFlow inside its own frame to trick clicks. HOW: window.top is
  // the outermost page. If it is not this window, we are inside a frame, so we erase the page. IMPROVE: also send a
  // frame-blocking header from your host.
  if (window.top !== window.self) {
    document.documentElement.innerHTML = '';
    // WHY: after blanking, try to open MangaFlow as the real top page. HOW: sets the top window address to ours inside
    // try/catch, because a sandboxed frame may refuse. IMPROVE: show a short message with a link instead of a blank page.
    try { window.top.location = window.self.location.href; } catch { /* a sandboxed frame may not navigate: stay blank */ }
    // WHY: stop the rest of the script from running inside a hostile frame. HOW: 'return' leaves the wrapper function early.
    // IMPROVE: none needed.
    return;
  }
  // WHY: one safe gate for every address we open or fetch, so javascript: or file: links are refused. HOW: new URL()
  // parses the text, we accept only http/https and return the clean address, otherwise null. IMPROVE: also block local
  // network addresses.
  const safeWebUrl = u => { try { const x = new URL(u); return (x.protocol === 'http:' || x.protocol === 'https:') ? x.href : null; } catch { return null; } };

  /* ---------------------------------------------------------------
     1. SMALL HELPERS
     WHY: $ / $$ shorten document.querySelector; `store` wraps localStorage in try/catch because
          it throws in private mode or when full.
     HOW: every saved value gets the prefix "mf_" so we never clash with other sites' data.
     IMPROVE: move to IndexedDB if you store lots of data (offline chapters). */
  // WHY: a short name for document.querySelector so the code is less long. HOW: finds the first element matching a CSS
  // selector, inside root r (default: the whole page). IMPROVE: none needed.
  const $ = (s, r = document) => r.querySelector(s);
  // WHY: same idea as $ but returns ALL matches as a real array, so forEach/map work. HOW: querySelectorAll gives a
  // NodeList, Array.from converts it. IMPROVE: none needed.
  const $$ = (s, r = document) => Array.from(r.querySelectorAll(s));
  // ROUND 29a - THE REOPEN COVER (see boot.js). It lives up here with the helpers because startReading() also calls it, and a const is only usable after its line has run. WHY: after a refresh or a reopened browser the start screen used to flash before the page came back. boot.js puts the class
  //   "mf-resuming" on <html> before the first paint (style.css then shows #resume over everything); endResume() takes it away again. HOW: it is called when the reopen has finished
  //   OR failed (try / finally below), so the person is never stuck behind the cover; boot.js also removes it after 30 s by itself. It is safe to call twice. IMPROVE: fade it out.
  const endResume = () => { try { document.documentElement.classList.remove('mf-resuming'); } catch { /* nothing to do */ } };
  // WHY: safe wrapper around localStorage (the browser's small saved-data box). HOW: an object with get and set functions.
  // Both use try/catch because storage can throw in private mode or when full. IMPROVE: use IndexedDB for large data.
  // ROUND 14 (per-profile data): the four personal lists below get a "u:<user>:" prefix while a profile is signed in, so each profile
  // sees ONLY its own bookmarks / history. profiles.js saves the sign-in under mf_session and reloads the page after sign-in / sign-out,
  // so reading it once at start is enough. No profile signed in = the old plain keys (nothing is lost, "guest" data stays as it was).
  const NS_KEYS = ['recent', 'books', 'reads', 'progress'];
  // WHY: find the signed-in profile name. HOW: parse the small JSON that profiles.js stored; any problem means "nobody signed in".
  // IMPROVE: read it from a shared helper if more add-ons need it.
  const nsPrefix = (() => { try { const s = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('mf_session') || 'null'); return s && /^[a-z0-9._-]{3,20}$/.test(s.user || '') ? 'u:' + s.user + ':' : ''; } catch { return ''; } })();
  const store = {
    // WHY: read a saved value or give back a default d. HOW: adds the 'mf_' prefix (and the profile prefix for personal lists), reads the
    // text and turns it into data with JSON.parse. Any error returns d. IMPROVE: warn the user if the data is broken.
    get(k, d) { try { const v = localStorage.getItem('mf_' + (NS_KEYS.includes(k) ? nsPrefix : '') + k); return v ? JSON.parse(v) : d; } catch { return d; } },
    // WHY: save a value so it is still there next visit. HOW: turns the value into text with JSON.stringify and stores it
    // under 'mf_' + prefix + name; then tells profiles.js (event "mf-store") so it can copy the lists to the cloud. Errors are ignored on
    // purpose. IMPROVE: tell the user when saving fails.
    set(k, v) {
      try { localStorage.setItem('mf_' + (NS_KEYS.includes(k) ? nsPrefix : '') + k, JSON.stringify(v)); } catch { /* ignore */ }
      if (NS_KEYS.includes(k)) { try { window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('mf-store', { detail: { key: k } })); } catch { /* never break saving */ } }
    }
  };

  /* A proxy address pasted without "?url={url}" (e.g. https://NAME.workers.dev/) is completed
     automatically. WHY: without {url} the proxy never learns which page to fetch, so every request
     failed with "Failed to fetch". */
  // WHY: users paste proxy addresses without the {url} placeholder, and then every request failed. This repairs the
  // address. HOW: trims spaces, keeps it if it already has {url}, adds {url} after a trailing 'url=', or adds
  // '/?url={url}'. IMPROVE: test the proxy once.
  function fixProxy(p) {
    p = (p || '').trim();
    if (!p || p.includes('{url}')) return p;
    // WHY: a pasted proxy address may already end in ?url= . HOW: then only {url} is added; otherwise '/?url={url}' is
    // appended. IMPROVE: also accept ?u= styles.
    if (/[?&]url=$/i.test(p)) return p + '{url}';
    return p.replace(/\/+$/, '') + '/?url={url}';
  }
  // Short readable name of a proxy, e.g. "api.allorigins.win/raw". Used in lists and error messages.
  // WHY: a short readable proxy name for lists and error messages. HOW: swaps {url} for a dummy 'x' so new URL() works,
  // then joins the host name with the path. If parsing fails, return the raw text. IMPROVE: cut very long names.
  const proxyName = tpl => {
    try { const u = new URL(tpl.replace('{url}', 'x')); return u.hostname + (u.pathname.length > 1 ? u.pathname : ''); }
    catch { return tpl; }
  };
  // "example text" that people paste by mistake from the guide. We refuse to save it.
  // WHY: the guide contains example addresses like 'your-worker'. If someone pastes one by mistake it can never work. HOW:
  // a regular expression tests for those example words, ignoring capital letters. IMPROVE: show a message when one is
  // refused.
  const isExample = p => /your-worker|YOURNAME|NAME\.workers/i.test(p || '');

  /* ---------------------------------------------------------------
     2. SETTINGS + THEME
     WHY: Remember the user's theme, width, button side and proxy list between visits.
     HOW: `settings` starts with defaults, then saved values are copied over it.
          The proxy list is filled with the free defaults the FIRST time the site is opened
          (or when upgrading from the old one-proxy setting). After that the list is the user's own:
          removing a default does not bring it back, and "Reset to defaults" restores it.
     IMPROVE: add font/zoom, "auto-start reading mode" and image-quality options. */
  // WHY: the free proxies used when the user has none of their own. HOW: a list of address templates; {url} is replaced by
  // the page address later. IMPROVE: let users reorder them or load the list from a file you can update.
  const DEFAULT_PROXIES = [
    // NOTE: free public proxies come and go (corsproxy.io now needs a paid key, thingproxy is gone).
    // Treat these as a best-effort fallback only; your own proxy (worker.js) is the reliable route.
    // They can only do simple GET requests (no POST), see proxyList() below.
    'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url={url}',
    'https://api.codetabs.com/v1/proxy/?quest={url}'
  ];
  // WHY: builds the settings object: defaults first, then the saved values copied on top. HOW: Object.assign(defaults,
  // saved) lets saved values win. Each default is explained in its own line comment. IMPROVE: validate saved values (for
  // example a sensible width).
  const settings = Object.assign({

  //   It counts as "own" proxy everywhere (it is not in DEFAULT_PROXIES): Referer is sent, 15 s limit, used for fonts and pictures. Anyone can still add or

     3. FETCHING PAGES THROUGH A CORS PROXY
     WHY: Without a proxy the browser blocks the request. We ask ALL proxies at the same time and the
          first good answer wins, with a timeout so a dead proxy cannot freeze the app.
          `{url}` is replaced by the encoded page address.
     HOW: proxyList() builds the list. A local proxy at <this address>/proxy?url={url} is added automatically when
          the page itself is served from localhost (the test server in test/server.js does this; the old optional
          start-manga.bat helper did too, but it is NOT part of the uploaded files any more). POST requests (used for chapter lists) only go to proxies that
          are NOT in the free default list, because free public proxies cannot POST.
     IMPROVE: remember which proxy succeeded last and ask it first; retry with back-off. */
  // WHY: a memory of pages already fetched so going back or re-reading is instant and kinder to the proxies. HOW: a Map =
  // a list of key/value pairs, here address to HTML text. IMPROVE: expire old items by time and not only by count.
  const cache = new Map();                       // url -> html (so going back / re-reading is instant)

  // WHY: decides which proxies to ask. HOW: if the site runs on localhost, add the local launcher first. POST requests
  // skip the free default proxies because they cannot POST; GET uses all proxies. IMPROVE: put the last working proxy
  // first.
  // ROUND 19: PROXY HEALTH. WHY: a dead free proxy made every search wait 10 s per engine ("timed out after 10s" x5 engines = nearly a minute). HOW: askProxy
  // records success / failure per FREE proxy; two failures in a row put it to sleep for 5 minutes (it is skipped while another proxy exists). A success wakes it at
  // once. Your own proxies are never put to sleep. IMPROVE: show the sleeping ones in Settings > Proxies.
  const proxyHealth = new Map();                           // address -> { fails, until }

  /* ROUND 29e - HUMAN CHECK ("Just a moment...", "Verify you are human").
     WHY: many sites sit behind Cloudflare. When it doubts a visitor it shows a page that only a PERSON can pass (a tick box or a puzzle). Our helper (proxy) can never pass it, and the
          person was left with a red pop-up. HOW: HUMAN_RE finds the words / script names of such a page; HUMAN_MSG is the one sentence every layer uses (isHumanCheck() tests for it);
          humanHosts remembers which sites asked (host -> { url, opened }) so the rest of the chapters of that site wait quietly instead of asking again and again.
     HONEST LIMIT: the "I am human" proof is saved in the cookies of the browser that solved it, and the helper runs somewhere else, so passing the check in a tab can not always let the helper
          in. It works when the site relaxes the check after a person passed it (very common), otherwise the person reads that chapter on the site itself. MangaFlow never solves or skips a check.

     4b. SEARCH ENGINES   (ROUND 16)
     WHY: DuckDuckGo's plain page sometimes answers a cloud proxy with a CAPTCHA ("are you a robot?"). MangaFlow must NEVER try

          moves on to another FREE search engine, so searching still works like a normal search box.
     HOW: ENGINES lists free engines that have a simple page without JavaScript. searchCandidates() puts the engine you chose
          first and the others after it. navigate() tries them one by one and stops at the first real result page.
          Google is NOT in the list: Google blocks proxies and its rules forbid automatic searching, so Google is never fetched
          through a proxy. (Round 16 opened google.com in a new tab; since rounds 18-28b Google answers INSIDE MangaFlow through
          YOUR Programmable Search panel or, with a key, the Google API - see section 18 and googleSearch.)

          "Original page" under the list still opens the engine's own page. Only the title and the first words of the text are

     5. ERRORS (BIG POP-UP), TOAST, BUSY, LOADING BAR   (rewritten in round 8)
     WHY: slow proxies feel broken without feedback, and a problem that is only a tiny red line is easy to miss.
          Round 8 turns every problem into a BIG pop-up in the middle of the screen (a modal <dialog>) with
            1. a title and the problem in one plain sentence,
            2. a hint that says what you can do,
            3. a full report you can copy and send to Claude (page address, proxies, what was happening, browser).
     HOW: showError(message, { title, hint, details }) builds the pop-up. explain(message) picks the title and hint
          by looking for key words (bot check, 403, "no images" ...). The same message is not shown again for
          8 seconds, so one broken site cannot bury you in pop-ups. If a pop-up is already open, new problems are
          added to its report instead of opening another one.
          The error handlers at the very bottom of this file (section 16) send EVERY unexpected crash here too.

     7b. MAKING OTHER SITES LOOK COMPLETE (round 15)
     WHY: people open normal sites in the mini browser (not only manga). Some looked broken: unstyled, black boxes instead of icons.
          Reasons found: (a) a style sheet was refused when fetched directly (hotlink / Referer rules, mixed http), (b) an icon font
          needs a CORS permission its host does not give, (c) the site hides the page until a script shows it (we run no scripts, on
          purpose, for your safety).
     HOW: 2.5 s after the page is shown we look at the live frame. Style sheets that did not load are fetched through your proxy and put
          into the page as <style> text (url(...) made absolute; font files sent through the proxy, which adds the CORS permission). If a
          font failed, all sheets are repaired that way. Then pageHealth() decides whether to show the "may look incomplete" notice with a
          copyable report. Scripts of other sites still never run.
     LIMITS: pages built entirely by JavaScript (React, Vue ...) stay mostly empty: that is reported honestly, not hidden.

  /* OPENING A PAGE  (round 8: can go straight into reading mode)
     WHY: before, pasting the address of a manga's main page only showed the site's page; you had to press
          "Reading mode" or edit the link to ".../chapter-1". Now a link you PASTE or TYPE (opts.user) is checked
          after it loads: if it is a manga page (chapter pictures, or a chapter list of its own) reading mode
          starts by itself, from the chapter you stopped at last time (history) or from chapter 1.
     HOW: navigate() loads and shows the page, then starts enhanceSeriesPage() (fetches hidden chapter lists).
          tryAutoRead() waits for that, decides "is this a manga?" and calls startReading({ quiet: true }).
          quiet = no error pop-up when it does not work out (the page simply stays open for you to choose).
          The site's front page, search results and pages with no chapters are never auto-read.

  // HISTORY. ROUND 26: reader-box detection for WordPress "MangaReader"-style themes (.reading-content, .reader ...). ROUND 27 (bug B1): round 26 had its own BAD_IMG with the loose word
  //   "ads?", which also matches "upl-OADS" in /wp-content/uploads/, so the pictures of WordPress sites were thrown away, and a picture inside two nested reader boxes was added twice.
  //   Both fixes now live in readerSlots() below (the shared BAD_IMG, and a Set that counts every picture once).
  /* ROUND 28 - PICTURES THAT HAVE NO ADDRESS YET ("empty page slots"): mgread.io and every site built with the "Init Manga" theme
     WHY: the owner opened https://mgread.io/manga/childhood-friend-of-the-zenith/chapter-1/ and saw ONLY page 1 of the chapter. The page lists 7 or more <img> tags for the chapter,
          but only the FIRST one has a real address. The others are empty grey boxes (a tiny drawing "data:image/svg+xml", 800 wide and about 15500 tall) that the site's own
          JavaScript fills in later. MangaFlow never runs the scripts of other sites (a safety rule), so it only saw one picture. Worse: the page also has a "recommended manga" block
          of cover pictures inside links, and the old rule "this is only a list of manga" threw ALL pictures away, so the page was not even seen as a chapter (and the error then said
          LOCKED because of the words in the menu and the comment box).
     HOW: four small helpers, used by scanPictures():
          imgAddress()   reads the real address of ONE <img>: the lazy-load attributes we know first, then ANY other attribute whose value looks like a picture address
                         (themes invent names such as data-page-src or data-original-src), then src, then srcset. A "data:" address is never a real picture.
          isHolder()     an <img> that has NO address but is clearly a page slot: a tall empty drawing, "Image 3" in its alt text, or loading=lazy and empty.
          readerSlots()  walks the known reader boxes (READER_BOX), skipping side blocks (menus, "recommended", comments), collects the real addresses AND counts the empty slots.
          scanPictures() decides between the reader box and the older general rules, and returns { list, holders } so the reader can say "7 pages expected, 1 address known"
                         and then try to complete the list (chapterPictures, further down).

          page and the Prev / Next buttons are placeholders ("#/prev/") that the site's own JavaScript fills in later.

     WHY: scanPictures() can say "7 page slots, but only 1 address". The reader should still show the WHOLE chapter when that is honestly possible, and say plainly when it is not.
     HOW: chapterPictures() asks, in this order, and keeps the first answer that fills every slot:
          1. the page text again (pageTextPictures): the other addresses are often written somewhere an <img> tag does not show (a script, a hidden data block, <noscript>). Only
             addresses in the SAME folder as the first picture count, so a banner or a cover can never slip in.
          2. the scripts (fromScripts, round 8).
          3. numbering (inferNumbered): the first picture is called 1.webp, so the others are 2.webp ... N.webp, where N is the number of slots on the page. Picture 2 and the LAST
             picture are asked for first; only when both really exist is the whole list trusted. Never more pictures than the page has slots.
          When the page carries the theme's own "encrypted chapter" marker (sealedPage) step 3 is NOT used: that is the site hiding its pictures ON PURPOSE, and MangaFlow does not
          guess around it. What the page plainly gives is shown, with a clear note and a button that opens the site.

     9b. THE KEEPER  (round 29d) - keeps the next chapters ready and heals failed pictures / chapters by itself
     WHY: the owner: "when the internet fluctuates some pages do not load and I have to refresh or press Retry. I want the missing pages (of the chapter I read, the 2nd, the 4th ...)
          to keep loading in the background by themselves, and the next nine chapters to be preloaded."
     HOW: ONE small timer (every 1.5 s, only while you are in reading mode, the tab is visible and the device is online) looks at the chapters on the page and does at most this:
          A. KEEP READY - the chapter boxes are loaded up to (the chapter you read + preloadAhead); loadNext() makes the boxes, fillChapter() fills them.
          B. HEAL CHAPTERS - a box that failed (data-failed="1", set by fillChapter) is loaded again, ONE at a time, nearest to you first. Waiting time before each new try:
             healBaseMs (4 s), 8 s, 16 s ... up to 90 s (+-15 % so many boxes do not retry at the same second). It never stops while the box is on the page.
          C. HEAL PICTURES - a picture that ran out of ways to load (img._failed, the red "Page N could not be loaded" box) is reloaded with img._reload(), at most 3 at a time,
             nearest first, with the same growing waits; a picture that is "loading" for more than 45 s (a stalled connection never sends an error) is reloaded too.
          D. PRELOAD PICTURES - pictures are lazy (the browser loads them near the screen). The keeper switches the pictures of the chapters in the window (you .. you + preloadAhead)
             to eager, nearest first, at most 4 loading at the same time (3 on a phone-sized screen), so the next chapters are really in the cache when you get there.
          The keeper also wakes up at once when the internet comes back ("online") or the tab becomes visible again (it forgets the waiting times).
     LIMITS: it keeps the data use in mind: with the browser's "data saver" it keeps only 1 chapter ready, with a device that reports 2 GB memory or less only 3. Setting preloadAhead = 0 (Settings >
          Reading > "Keep the next chapters ready") switches D and A off, healing (B, C) always stays on. It never works around a site's protection: a chapter that says "verify you are human"
          (round 29e) is not retried until the person has verified. It does nothing in the start page or the mini browser.
     IMPROVE: show a small "N pictures still loading" indicator; learn which picture hosts need the proxy first; pause while a PDF download is running on a very slow line. */

          scrolling up (the page only ever grew downwards), so you could only go forward.
     HOW: R.first is the number of the first chapter that is on the page. loadPrev() builds the boxes of the chapters
          before it (5 at a time), puts them ABOVE the first one (stream.insertBefore) and then scrolls by exactly the
          height that was added, so the picture you are looking at does not move. They start loading at once.
          It is triggered by: scrolling up near the top, the mouse wheel / a finger drag / the Up, PageUp and Home keys at
          the very top (the page cannot scroll there, so no scroll event comes), the "Load earlier chapters" button, and
          the up round key / Left arrow when the chapter before the first one is wanted (goChapter).
     LIMITS: a browser without "scroll anchoring" (old Safari) is helped by keepView() and makeImg(), which scroll by hand when a
             box ABOVE the screen changes height.

          itself (observer clearIO), and (2) a PDF download still knows the chapter.

     11. SCROLL TRACKING + AUTO-HIDING UI  (changed in round 2)
     WHY: the title bar and the arrow keys cover the art, so they hide while you read downwards.
          NEW RULE: they come back ONLY when you scroll UP (mouse wheel up, finger drag down, Up / PageUp / Home key,
          scrollbar drag up) or when you reach the very top. They no longer come back by themselves after a pause.
     HOW: on every scroll event we compare the new position with the last one.
          Down more than 14 px in a row  -> hide.   Up more than 14 px in a row -> show.
          The 14 px "dead zone" stops tiny finger wobbles from flickering the buttons.
          lastInput remembers when the PERSON last used wheel / touch / keyboard / scrollbar. Scroll events that
          happen long after that (pictures loading and moving the page) are ignored, so they cannot hide or show
          the buttons by accident.
     WHERE: onScroll() runs on every scroll event; showUi/hideUi toggle body.scrolling, which style.css uses to fade .ui-hide items
            (title bar buttons and the #side key block). goChapter/jumpTo set lastInput = 0 so key jumps do not hide the keys.
     IMPROVE: make the 14 px and 1.5 s numbers settings; add a small "show buttons" handle at the screen edge. */

     12. PDF DOWNLOAD (the "Download all chapters" button)
     WHY: read offline. One PDF with every chapter that is loaded in reading mode, in reading order.
          ROUND 6: each chapter is ONE long page (a "long strip"), exactly like the reading mode:
          a title block at the top (manga name, chapter number, chapter title), all pictures stacked, and an
          "End of Chapter N" block at the bottom, in the same white/black theme. The file is named after the manga.
     HOW:
       1. Each page picture is downloaded as BYTES (fetchBytes). Browsers only allow that when the picture
          host sends a CORS permission, so we try: direct -> your proxies -> images.weserv.nl (last resort).
          The route that worked is remembered per website to make the next pages faster.
       2. addPageImage() puts the bytes in the PDF. JPEG and simple PNG are copied untouched (best quality,
          smallest size). WebP/GIF/other formats are decoded by the browser and stored losslessly
          (or as JPEG 98% if you chose "smaller files" in Settings).
       3. addTextPage() draws the title block and the "End of Chapter N" block with a canvas, so every language works.
       4. A picture that cannot be downloaded is NEVER skipped silently: a placeholder block says which page
          is missing, and the final message lists them.
       5. pdfmaker.js stacks everything of one chapter on one tall page. The picture data is never changed, so
          quality is the same as the source files (see pdfmaker.js for the page-size rules).
     WHERE: started by #btnDl (end of reading mode) and #btnDlMenu (chapter menu) -> range dialog (12b) -> download manager (12c);
            markup in index.html (#dlBar, #rangeDlg, #dock), styles in style.css, PDF writer = pdfmaker.js.
     IMPROVE: write to disk while downloading (File System Access API), resume after a failure, and let
              the person pick a chapter range. Very large PDFs (hundreds of MB) can run out of memory on phones. */
  /* ROUND 11: PICTURE QUALITY CHOICES (shown in the download window and in Settings; each shows its estimated size).
     WHY: "Smaller files" (JPEG 92%) still made 30 MB per chapter, because the browser stores 92%+ JPEGs with full colour detail
          (no chroma subsampling) - about twice the size of 82% with no visible difference on manga. One choice was not enough.
     HOW: q = JPEG quality for pictures that must be re-encoded; maxW = widest picture allowed (0 = keep the size);
          jpeg / png = what to do with a JPEG / PNG that arrives: 'keep' copies the bytes untouched (no quality change at all),
          'smaller' re-encodes it but ONLY uses the result when it really is smaller than the original.
          WebP / GIF / AVIF can not live inside a PDF, so they are always converted (to JPEG at quality q).
     IMPROVE: grey-scale JPEG for black-and-white pages (3x smaller again), a custom quality slider. */

     HOW: jobs[] is the list. queueDownload() adds one, runQueue() runs them one after another (one at a time keeps
          memory and proxy use low). runJob() builds one PDF per "part" (a part = the chapters of one file).
          buildPart() fetches missing chapter pages, then every picture, in reading order, into one long strip per chapter.

          3. addNoNextButton() puts a "report" button on the last chapter. 4. selfCheck() lists what works; FIX.* are the repair
             buttons; autoFix() runs the safe ones in order. 5. diagnostic() makes the full text that goes into the Claude questions.
          Texts of the guide live in troubleshoot-data.js (window.MF_FIX).
