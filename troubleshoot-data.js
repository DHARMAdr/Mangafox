   MangaFlow - troubleshoot-data.js   (round 11, OPTIONAL data file)
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHY it exists:
     Settings > Troubleshoot > "Symptoms & answers" shows a guide made from the lists in this file:
       1. SYMPTOMS  = things you may see, the most likely cause (a "theory") and buttons that fix it.
       2. PROMPTS   = ready-made questions you can copy and paste to Claude. The word {{REPORT}} is replaced by a full
                      diagnostic report (settings, proxies, last errors, download diary) when you press "Copy".
   WHY a separate file: it is only TEXT, so you can add new symptoms or questions without touching app.js.
                        If the file is missing, the troubleshooter still runs its checks, only the guide is empty.
   HOW to add a symptom:   copy one block, give it a new id, and use these button names in "fix":
       reloadChapter, reloadAll, clearCaches, retryPictures, freeMemory, cancelStuck, safePdf, testProxies, openProxies, openDownload,
       resetEngine, clearApiKey, resetProxies, reloadPage   (14 buttons in all; round 28 corrected this list, it named only the first 10)
       (the buttons are defined in app.js section 17, object FIX).
   HOW to add a question: copy a block in PROMPTS and write the text. {{REPORT}} may appear once.
   IMPROVE: add a "site" field so the guide can show only the symptoms that match the site you are on, and
            translate the texts into other languages.

Theory 2 (round 28): the site shows its chapters in PAGES ("1 2 3 ... 5", often 24 per page, address ending in /page/2/); MangaFlow now reads all the pages and tells you if one of them could not be loaded.',

      why: 'Theory 1: an ad-blocker or privacy mode blocks cse.google.com. Theory 2: the search-engine ID (Settings > Search & extras) is wrong or the engine is not public. Theory 3: the Google engine\'s "sites to search" list decides which sites appear (change it in the Google control panel). MangaFlow then falls back to the free engines by itself.

      why: 'Theory 1: the site writes the address of only the first picture(s) in its page and fills in the others with its own JavaScript, which MangaFlow never runs. Round 28 reads every attribute of the picture tags, the page text and the scripts, and works out numbered pictures (1.webp, 2.webp ...) when the page says how many there are. Theory 2: the report line "encrypted-chapter marker" says true: the site hides its pictures on purpose and MangaFlow does not break that - use "Open on the site" under the chapter. Theory 3: the picture host answers only readers that come from the site: use your own proxy (worker.js).',

A title that is not on those sites finds nothing, so MangaFlow shows the free engines with a yellow note.

      why: 'Theory 1: they only show in reading mode. Theory 2: they hide while you scroll down and return when you scroll up. Theory 3: the file chapter-slider.js or reload-wheel.js is not next to index.html (they are optional).',

What to do: press "Open the site" (a new tab opens), pass the check there until the real page shows, come back to MangaFlow (it tries again by itself, or press "I did it - try again"). If the check comes back at once, the site also refuses helpers like our proxy because your pass is saved in YOUR browser only: read that chapter on the site itself, or try again later.',
